5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: A way to maintain order in a database. Having everything have its own identifier allows for better management of large data sets.

  Researched answer: A primary key is way to identify the set of information in a database without a chance to have it bring up the wrong information. An example of this would be if you want to retrieve information such as a name but two people with the same name exist in your records. the Primary key will allow for you to not call the wrong persons information. 

 their history, use cases, and how the relate to other pieces of data that you could touch on.

I would happily hear about your experience with primary keys.: I have no experience in coding with primary keys what I do have relational experience in is with excel sheets. If you outline an area and chose to use the sort function by default it will use the first column as a primary key to sort by. If you chose a different column to sort by then that will be the primary key in regards to how all the other information will be ordered.
